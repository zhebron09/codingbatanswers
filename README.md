# CodingBat Solutions:
CodingBat problems as I see them with a focus on trying to only use if statements and loops. Avoid helper methods as much as possible to focus on building core skills.

### TIPS FOR NEW CODERS
* There is always more than one solution to a problem so be open to different logic so if you can't solve it with one approach...try another.
* Learn your core JAVA before worrying about memorizing helper methods...they won't help you learn if you can't understand the basics.
* ***PRACTICE*** ***PRACTICE*** ***PRACTICE*** 30 minutes to a hour everyday will change your coding life...it is your choice to put in the time!
